## **Course Overview**

This course teaches the end-to-end process of building production-ready Generative AI (GenAI) applications. Participants will learn how to design, build, deploy, and maintain modern AI systems using LLMs, embeddings, vector databases, RAG pipelines, and scalable backend/frontend architectures.

The course follows a **hands-on, project-based approach**, culminating in a fully functional GenAI application deployed to the cloud.
